					<h1>My Development<br />
						Journey</h1>
					<p>So lets's start from the top from where it all began, I grew up without much to my name and
						without much to go off as far as guidance to the right choice for success in life. I came from a
						family of 6 always struggling for food, clothes, basic necessities, etc. Honestly I would say
						there were times I didn't realize how humble my beginnings were, I believe it was my youth that
						shielded me from the knowledge of being poor.<br />
					</p>

				<div class="image main"><img src="images/trophy.jpeg" alt="" /> <q>"Winners Never Quit & Quitters Never
						Win" - Vince Lombardi</q></div>
				<p>Even through it all I think the best thing I can say <em>"Life is a Highway...",</em> there's alot of
					twist and turns on the way to your destinations in life and the road carries on high and even low
					sometimes, we're all just trying not to crash along the way. I think one thing I also learned is no
					matter hard it gets we keep pushing for what we want in this world. There's an old saying that will
					always stick in my heart <em>"Never Give Up..."</em> I've had so many trials and tribulations
					throughout my life but I'm here now and I made it through, you can too!</p>

				<p>I think we have all heard things that were far from the truth and there's alot of things we never get
					the answer for, some anomalies through out the entire universe if you will, but I'll give you the
					truth. If I was to ask my past self what I'd be doing in the Future I would of never got the answer
					of being positioned in the <em>"Tech World"</em>, or to be engolfed in this industry or even want to
					learn as much as I do. Like most people I wanted to be all the things you would see on the TV in a
					sense the <i>As Seen On Tv</i> type of lifestyle, but I found that none of that interests me or
					excites me the way Software Engineering and Developing does. I see the amazing things that can be done
					through what we do as a collective through out the world and the collabrative ideas, thoughts,
					plans, and designs that are created to better the future. I think what I do now even though I
					cannot take credit alone because there are so many great developers and engineers in the field
					already and some of the greatest minds have brought us products that we now know and love as a
					household name and product that there's no room for me to say that. I understand I can't do this
					alone but I know the thing we do together help and touch the world in so many ways. Take Schools,
					Businesses, Hospitals, and many much needed Government agencies for instance this makes there job
					easier so we can have fluid moving economy ensuring that the well being of the world stays intact
					not to exclude our beautiful country <i>The United States of America</i>.</p>
